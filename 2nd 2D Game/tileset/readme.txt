You have full rights to use this tileset in any game so long that it's non-commercial. If you want to use this tileset in a commercial project, please contact me.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could donate, if this were to be used in a commercial project. It's not neccesary, though.

You may not use this tileset in any game if you do not give credit, commercial or otherwise.

** What defines commercial? **

If you can make money from this tileset, or in other words, my artwork, in any way shape or form (either donations, outright purchasing a product, or using this in a public project and having a Patreon or similiar service avalible to give you money), I consider it fully commercial. Like I said, please contact me if you are going to use it.
